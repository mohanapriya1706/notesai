## NotesAI - Prototype 

### Problem:

When watching YouTube videos or any course videos involving theories, for example learning about the stock market, I often struggle to take detailed notes. I can usually capture only important points or keywords, but not full explanations or context.

### Idea:

I am building NotesAI â€” an AI assistant that helps generate detailed and organized notes based on the key points I provide. This tool will allow users to quickly jot down keywords and have NotesAI expand them into full, meaningful notes in real-time or afterward.
